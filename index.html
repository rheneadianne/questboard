                            probably need to camp out at Falcon's for a little bit. I'll give you some funds for a 3
                            nights stay. If you use it for something else good luck sleeping at his guest house. You can
                            smell the horse manure if you open the windows even the slightest...<br /><br />

                        <p>
                            Deep in the mountains of the southeast is a small clan of clever rock gnomes (though they're
                            quite
                            the recluses). They call themselves the gnomes of Gnomengarde. Nonetheless, they're crafty
                            and
                            have
                            a knack for magical weapons. Find them and buy some magical items that would be useful in
                            felling
                            the horrid beast that roams our once peaceful skies. Please have the gnomes print a receipt.
                            <br /><br />
                            You may keep all magical items ONLY IF!!! You SWEAR to aide the plight in killing the Great

                            Menace.
